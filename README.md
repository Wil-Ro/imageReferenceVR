# imageReferenceVR
A virtual reality app that overlays reference images over art software to allow artists to drag reference images into apps that dont support them.

This is a web-app that runs in Aardvark, its inherently multi-user and achieves this both through Aardvarks clever inner-workings and a decentralised storage system known as IPFS, check out aardvark [here](https://github.com/aardvarkxr/aardvark).
